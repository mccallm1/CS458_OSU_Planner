NOTES FOR TA:

  - The SQL Database used in our project is hosted on Miles' ONID server.

  - The populateDB.php contains the credentials for mccallm's DB,
    and will recreate and repopulate the full database when ran.

    - The data is already present in the database so this script doesn't need
      to be ran before viewing the site. If the data is altered or an error occurs,
      running this script will likely fix the issue. 

  - mainPage.php is the front end script the user interacts with.

      - It queries the generated tables and displays the student's data
        in our visual prototype.
